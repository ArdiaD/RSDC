\title{Estimate Regime-Switching or Constant Correlation Model}
\usage{
estimate_model(
  method = c("tvtp", "noX", "const"),
  residuals,
  N = 2,
  X = NULL,
  out_of_sample = FALSE,
  control = list()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{method}{Character string. One of:
\itemize{
\item \code{"tvtp"}: Regime switching with time-varying transition probabilities driven by \code{X}.
\item \code{"noX"}: Regime switching with constant transition probabilities (no covariates).
\item \code{"const"}: Constant correlation model (no regime switching or covariates).
}}

\item{residuals}{A numeric matrix of dimension T × K. Typically standardized residuals or returns.}

\item{N}{Integer. Number of regimes. Ignored if \code{method = "const"}.}

\item{X}{A numeric matrix of exogenous covariates (T × p). Required only for \code{method = "tvtp"}.}

\item{out_of_sample}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, uses 70\\% of the data for estimation and 30\\% for out-of-sample analysis.}

\item{control}{Optional list of control options. Currently supports \code{do_trace = TRUE} for verbose output during optimization.}
}
\value{
A list containing the estimated model parameters. See the return values of
\code{\link{f_optim}}, \code{\link{f_optim_noX}}, and \code{\link{f_optim_const}} for details.
}
\description{
A unified wrapper function to estimate correlation models with or without regime switching,
and with or without exogenous transition variables. This function delegates to one of:
\itemize{
\item \code{f_optim()} for regime switching with exogenous covariates (\code{method = "tvtp"})
\item \code{f_optim_noX()} for regime switching with fixed transition probabilities (\code{method = "noX"})
\item \code{f_optim_const()} for a constant correlation model with no regime switching (\code{method = "const"})
}
}
