\title{Estimate Constant Correlation Model}
\usage{
f_optim_const(residuals, control = list())
}
\arguments{
\item{residuals}{A numeric matrix of dimension T × K. Typically standardized residuals or returns.}

\item{control}{Optional list of control parameters passed to the DEoptim optimizer (e.g., \code{do_trace = TRUE}).}
}
\value{
A list with the following components:
\describe{
\item{transition_matrix}{A 1 × 1 matrix with value 1 (since there is no switching).}
\item{means}{A placeholder matrix of zeros (1 × K) for the regime mean (not estimated).}
\item{volatilities}{A placeholder matrix of ones (1 × K) for the regime volatility (not estimated).}
\item{correlations}{A 1 × C matrix of estimated correlation coefficients, where C = K(K−1)/2.}
\item{covariances}{A 3D array of dimension K × K × 1 containing the full correlation matrix.}
\item{log_likelihood}{The log-likelihood value of the fitted constant-correlation model.}
\item{beta}{\code{NULL} (no covariates used).}
}
}
\description{
Estimates a single correlation matrix under the assumption that asset correlations are constant over time.
This model does not include regime switching or exogenous covariates.
}
\details{
Estimation is performed by maximizing the log-likelihood of a multivariate normal distribution
with constant correlation, using differential evolution followed by L-BFGS-B optimization.
