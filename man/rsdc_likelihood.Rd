\title{Negative Log-Likelihood for Regime-Switching Correlation Model}
\usage{
rsdc_likelihood(params, y, exog = NULL, K, N)
}
\arguments{
\item{params}{A numeric vector of model parameters. This includes:
\itemize{
\item If \code{exog} is \code{NULL}: \eqn{N(N-1)} transition probabilities (one per off-diagonal regime),
followed by \eqn{N \cdot K(K-1)/2} correlation parameters.
\item If \code{exog} is not \code{NULL}: \eqn{N \cdot p} logistic regression coefficients
(where \code{p = ncol(exog)}), followed by \eqn{N \cdot K(K-1)/2} correlation parameters.
}}

\item{y}{A numeric matrix of dimension \eqn{T \times K}, where \eqn{T} is the number of time steps and
\eqn{K} the number of observed variables (e.g., asset returns).}

\item{exog}{Optional. A numeric matrix of dimension \eqn{T \times p} of exogenous variables.
If provided, a time-varying transition model is used.}

\item{K}{Integer. Number of observed variables (columns in \code{y}).}

\item{N}{Integer. Number of regimes.}
}
\value{
A numeric scalar: the negative log-likelihood of the model (to be minimized).
}
\description{
Computes the negative log-likelihood of a multivariate regime-switching correlation model,
with either fixed or time-varying transition probabilities. The model assumes
regime-specific correlation matrices and uses the Hamilton filter for likelihood evaluation.
}
\details{
The function evaluates the log-likelihood of the data under a regime-switching
correlation model using the Hamilton filter. Two types of transition dynamics are supported:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Fixed transition matrix} when \code{exog = NULL}. Transition probabilities are estimated directly.
\item \strong{Time-varying transition probabilities (TVTP)} when \code{exog} is provided. In this case,
regime persistence probabilities are modeled via a logistic function:
\deqn{p_{ii,t} = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-X_t^\top \beta_i)}}
}

The Hamilton filter computes the filtered and smoothed regime probabilities internally.
The negative log-likelihood is returned for use in optimization routines.
