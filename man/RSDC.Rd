\title{RSDC: Regime-Switching Correlation Models for Portfolio Analysis}
\description{
\code{RSDC} is an R package for modeling and comparing correlation structures across regimes in multivariate time series.
It implements a regime-switching correlation framework with or without exogenous variables in the transition probabilities
(Time-Varying Transition Probabilities â€“ TVTP), and allows full pipeline integration including model fitting, covariance
reconstruction, and portfolio optimization (e.g., minimum variance, maximum diversification).

The package is designed for empirical asset pricing and portfolio applications, and supports the inclusion of predictors
such as macroeconomic or climate-related indices to investigate time-varying market regimes.
